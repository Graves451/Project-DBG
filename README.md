an online text-based rpg game developed on the discord platform 

# How to play
Playing the game is really simple, **just join the [server](https://discord.gg/8jtZxk682h) for free and get started playing Project DBG** \
After you join, you should be automatically registered and ready to play, if you are not, then you might want to use the `.register` command to get signed up.
if you need some help check out the [guide](https://github.com/Graves451/Project-DBG/wiki) to get yourself started.
